# Chatbot for ASD Detection

This project explores the development of a prototype chatbot designed to support early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It interacts with users through a conversation flow using the powerful Gemini API, prompting them with questions and analyzing their responses for potential ASD indicators.

**Disclaimer:**

**It is important to emphasize that this chatbot is for informational purposes only and should not be used for definitive ASD diagnosis. Diagnosis should always be conducted by qualified healthcare professionals.**

## Technology Stack

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP): (Optional)** While Gemini handles some NLP internally, you can use additional NLP libraries for deeper analysis.
* **Python:** The primary language for interacting with the Gemini API.
* **Node.js :** Used for server-side management .
* **Google Cloud Project:** Required to access the Gemini API.

## Impact

This chatbot has the potential to:

* Provide a preliminary screening tool for parents and healthcare providers.
* Enhance early intervention by encouraging reflection on potential ASD indicators.
* Offer a potentially accessible and convenient way to explore ASD concerns through a natural conversational interface.

## Next Steps

* Refine conversation flow and questions based on established ASD criteria.
* Implement logic to guide user interaction and manage conversation history.
* Consider incorporating additional NLP analysis on top of Gemini's responses (optional).
* Conduct user testing to improve usability.

## Ethical Considerations

* **Transparency:** Clearly state the limitations of the chatbot and emphasize the need for professional evaluation.
* **Avoidance of Medical Diagnosis:** Refrain from providing definitive diagnostic statements.
* **Data Privacy:** If you plan to collect user data, ensure informed consent and secure storage practices in accordance with Google Cloud's policies.

## Using the Gemini API

This project leverages the Gemini API from Google AI to generate human-like responses based on user input.  You will need a Google Cloud Project and an API key to access the service. Refer to the official documentation for details on setting up and using the Gemini API: (https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/new_chat?utm_source=agd&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=core-cta&utm_content=)

**Important Note:**

While the Gemini API is powerful, it's still under development. Its responses may not always be perfectly aligned with the complexities of ASD detection. Always prioritize professional evaluation and responsible use of this chatbot.
